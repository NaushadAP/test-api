        "blog": "\n Customer wooing is similar to dating. No, you are not allowed to present the engagement ring on your first date! Before leading to the church doors, there is a two-way connection that needs to build one step at a time. If you want the fulfillment of a life-long commitment, you can't rush it... or skip it. \n Getting to know your customer requires some time and effort. Customers have some characteristics that you, as a marketer, may capitalize on. Give them what they want, and they'll become the kind of devoted, long-term customers that help your business thrive. \n ## 1. Forget About Selling... Put The Emphasis On Buying \n People prefer to believe that all of their purchasing selections are the result of their brilliant ideas and astute shopping skills. Nobody likes a pushy salesperson. A salesperson who \"ASSISTS\" them in finding the greatest deal for their money, on the other hand, is a hero. \n In reality, when a customer goes into your store, they are most likely thinking about purchasing before they arrive. You do not need to encourage them to purchase. You may take it simple and just assist them in determining the finest buy. \n Maintain your attention to the consumer and his requirements. Consider... what advantages would he be most interested in? What are the most he can afford? Remember that you are there to satisfy his needs, not to persuade him. The pressure is off! \n ## 2. Make PurchasingÂ  A \"Sure Bet\" \n Purchasing is a \"risky\" business. The bigger the price tag, the greater the risk! Yes, a client is just searching for a product that meets the purposes for which he purchased it. \"Is it worth it?\" they think to themselves. \n Hey, it's a reasonable question. The world is full of frauds where you spend your money and end up with crap that doesn't last and can't be maintained. Customers are wary of impulsive purchases after a few hard lessons. They want to be able to rely on something. \n A money-back guarantee relieves the client of a great deal of anxiety. There's comfort in knowing that if the product fails to live up to its claims, customers won't be saddled with the cost of a piece of trash. \n Customer testimonials also plainly demonstrate to \"would-be\" buyers that you truly provide customer satisfaction. No one can say it better than a pleased customer, but don't use testimonials recklessly. You must have a method to your craziness. Choose clear and precise testimonials to utilize, and provide as much information about the consumer as possible to lend credibility to his testimony. \n ## 3. Let Them Know That It's An Easy Process \n Simplicity... makes everything so much easier. Your hurried clients are, indeed, busy and exhausted. They don't want to play games. Most of the time, they just want to buy something and go home. Convenience shops attest to the reality that convenience frequently trumps a lower price!\n Make the purchasing procedure as simple as possible. Keep in mind that not everyone appreciates the same approach. The more alternatives you provide, the more consumers you will impress.\nWhen you're preparing your marketing strategy, don't forget to emphasize your product's quick, easy, and convenient benefits. Keep in mind that price isn't everything. When you know what your consumers enjoy, it's very simple to enchant them! Keep these three strategies in mind as you tackle the arduous process of increasing your business and client list... and watch your revenues skyrocket.\n"

        "blog": "\n If you're anything like me, you've had lots of BAD customer service experiences. Consider the last time you had a poor encounter with a product or service. Perhaps the goods or service fell short of the sales presentation. Perhaps the firm did not respond to your calls or emails. Perhaps they did not follow through on their promises. When you phoned to report an issue or ask a question, they may have given you the runaround. \n When you think about it, all of these unpleasant encounters have one thing in common: a lack of customer service. A lack of customer service is generally the result of a lack of customer focus. Many firms appear to have simply lost sight of who they are in business to serve. Rather than the traditional adage that \"the customer is always right,\" many firms appear to be disturbed by customers these days. I'll let you in on a little secret from my early days at an advertising firm. \"This business would be fantastic if it weren't for the clients,\" we used to remark. Isn't that ridiculous? We wouldn't have had a job if it hadn't been for the clients \n Yes, clients might be tough at times, but they are the reason we are in business. It is our responsibility to serve them. If customers are dissatisfied, we should welcome the opportunity to learn why and utilize that knowledge to enhance our product or service. Yes, now and then you'll come into someone irrational, and you'll simply have to deal with it. Client complaints, on the other hand, frequently reveal an issue or an area where we can improve. \n As a result, make it a point to truly listen to your customers. Commit to treating all of your customers with respect. After all, providing excellent customer service is one of the most effective and inexpensive marketing tactics available. You will be rewarded if you serve your consumers properly, or even better if you exceed their expectations. \n Those satisfied customers are the same ones who will gladly suggest you. The inverse is also true. If you disappoint a customer, fail to deliver on your promises, or just treat them poorly, they will most likely tell everyone they know how awful you are. Your dissatisfied customers are more likely to spread the word about you than your satisfied customers. Unfortunately, that's how it generally goes. \n The good news is that providing excellent customer service is not difficult. All you have to do is be aware of it and make it a priority. Here are 10 tips to help you offer stellar customer service: \n ## 1.  Be Accessible \n If your customers have a query or want help, they should be able to contact you or someone in your organization. Give your consumers several means to reach you, such as email, phone, mail, or fax. \n ### 2.  Respond in a Timely Manner \n Make it your policy to respond to all phone calls and emails within 24 hours. And, if you are unable to commit to that, decide what period you can manage and inform your clients that they can expect to hear back from you within that timeframe. \n ### 3.  Listen to Your Customers \n When a customer calls or emails to complain, they frequently just want to be heard. In fact, sometimes simply listening is all that is required. Before replying to or defending your product or service, take the time to listen to what your consumers have to say. They may have a valid argument. \n ### 4.  Treat Your Customers with Respect \n Even if the customer on the other end of the phone is acting unreasonably or rudely, don't bring yourself down to their level by responding. Respect everyone, and you will be respected in return. Plus, you never know when someone is simply having a terrible day and decides to take it out on you. \n ### 5. Don't Argue with Your Customers \n A quarrel with a customer can never be won. Because even if you win, you've most certainly alienated the customer and lost their business. We've all heard that the customer isn't always right, but instead of focusing on what went wrong and defending yourself, consider how you can solve the problem or improve the situation. \n ### 6. Honor Your Commitments \n If you claim you'll respond to emails, do so. If you make a guarantee, keep it. Nothing ruins a customer relationship faster than being promised something and then failing to deliver. \n ### 7. Do What You Say \n If you say you'll call someone on Tuesday, then call them on Tuesday. That's all there is to it. You must follow through and accomplish what you say if you want your customers to trust and believe you. \n ### 8. Focus on Making Customer Relationships, Not Sales \n Your company's long-term success is dependent on your capacity to build long-term customer relationships. If you sacrifice connections in order to achieve short-term sales, your company will fail. \n ### 9. Be honest \n Don't overstate the benefits of your product or service. Don't make promises you can't keep merely to get a sale. People are duped into purchasing the thing, and subsequently, the product fails to deliver. Do you think the client will ever make another purchase from that company? Unlikely. Be upfront and honest about what your products and services can provide. \n ### 10. Admit When You Make a Mistake \n Nobody is perfect. We all make errors; it's part of the learning process. So, if you make a mistake, don't try to hide it or deny it. Simply accept it and, if required, take action to correct the problem. Your clients will enjoy it, and they will be more inclined to return. So, how does your customer service rank? Are you following these ten steps and providing excellent customer service? If not, I challenge you to improve your service. \n Commit to putting these ten suggestions into action. Learn about your customers. Make them the focal point of your company. It's one of the secrets to marketing success, and best of all, it's free!"
